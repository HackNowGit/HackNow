# Introduction

This notebook was originally created for the OSCP exam notes, however it also has additional resources and information related to pentesting. If you read through this entire notebook and all the attached resources, you will be beyond prepared for the OSCP. Let's go from zero to hero!&#x20;

## Best Courses for the OSCP (Ordered by How I Completed Them)

Even without the first group of CompTIA certifications I got, I believe the resources within my notebook is more than enough to pass without any prior experience

Make sure you study each resource thoroughly so you can actually absorb all the information. I recommend writing them down because your brain will remember things easier that way!

* A+, Net+, Security+, Pentest+, CySA+ Certifications (I do not think this is necessary)&#x20;
* [The Cyber Mentor's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLKT\_\_MCUeiwBa7d7F\_vN1GUwz\_2TmVQj) free Youtube playlist
* [IppSec's](https://www.youtube.com/c/ippsec/videos) videos over Hack the Box
* The above write-ups and notebooks
* [Metasploit Unleashed](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/)
* [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/DarthPwn) (check the link to look at all the 98 rooms I completed before moving on to the next step, going this overkill is not necessary; at least complete the complete beginner, offensive pentesting, and the web fundamentals paths for the best preparation)
* [TryHackMe Buffer Overflow Preparation](https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep) (amazing resource)
* [Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation-for-beginners/)
* [Linux Privilege Escalation for OSCP & Beyond!](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation/)
* [Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation-for-beginners/)
* [Windows Privilege Escalation for OSCP & Beyond!](https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation/)
* [Virtual Hacking Labs](https://www.virtualhackinglabs.com/) (can be skipped if it is outside of the budget, but it is highly recommended)
* [Proving Grounds Practice](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/individual/)
* Finally, after all of this preparation, the OSCP was purchased
