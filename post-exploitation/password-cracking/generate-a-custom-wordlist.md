# Generate a Custom Wordlist

## Who is the Target?

* The target might be a specific company or person.

## Password Rules

* the service you want to hack might have specific password rules
* must contain certain characters, must be of certain length, etc

## Combine a Small/Semi-Small Dictionary with a Custom List

* To combine two wordlists you can just do

```bash
cat wordlist.txt >> wordlist2.txt
```

## Create a Custom Wordlist

### Html2dic

* build a dictionary from a html-page

```bash
curl [http://example.com](http://example.com/) > example.txt
```

* then run

```bash
html2dic example.txt
```

* then you should probably remove duplicates

```bash
sort example.txt | uniq -u > nodupeexample.txt
```

### Cewl

* spider and build dictionary

```bash
cewl -w createWordlist.txt [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)
```

* add minimum password length

```bash
cewl -w createWordlist.txt -m 6 [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)
```

## Improve the custom wordlist

* some passwords are just simple words
* many use numbers and special characters
* to improve our password list we can use john the ripper
* input our own rules, or we can just use the standard john-the-ripper rules

```bash
john ---wordlist=wordlist.txt --rules --stdout > wordlist-modified.txt
```
