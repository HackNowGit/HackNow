# Cover Your Tracks

## Linux

### Log Files

* within this file you can read all the logs that syslog logs

```bash
/etc/syslog.conf
```

* lots of logs are stored here

```bash
/var/logs
/var/log/messages
```

* here you have failed and successful login attempts. SSH, SUDO, and much more

```bash
/var/log/auth.log
```

## Apache

```bash
/var/log/apache2/access.log
/var/log/apache2/error.log
```

### Remove your Own IP Like This

* what it does is simply copy all lines except the lines that contain your IP-address
* then move them, and them move them back again

```bash
grep -v '<src-ip-address>' /path/to/access_log > a && mv a /path/to/access_log
grep -v <entry-to-remove> <logfile> > /tmp/a ; mv /tmp/a <logfile> ; rm -f /tmp/a
```

## UTMP and WTMP

* these logs are not stored in plaintext but instead as binaries
* makes it a bit harder to clear

```bash
who
last
lastlog
```

## Command History

* all your commands are also stored

```bash
echo $HISTFILE
echo $HISTSIZE
```

* set your file-size like this to zero, to avoid storing commands
* set it when you get a shell you don't worry about cleaning up the history

```bash
export HISTSIZE=0
```

## Shred Files

* shredding files lets you remove files in a more secure way

```bash
shred -zu filename
```

## On Windows

* clear env
