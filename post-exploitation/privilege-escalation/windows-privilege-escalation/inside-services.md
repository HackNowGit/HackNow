# Inside Services

## Overview

* sometimes there are services that are only accessible from inside the network
* for example a MySQL server or a printer

## Example

* look for LISTENING/LISTEN and compare that to the scan you did from the outside
* does it contain any ports that are not accessible from the outside?
* if that is the case, maybe you can make a remote forward to access it

### So How Should We Interpret the Netstat Output?

* local address 0.0.0.0 means that the service is listening on all interfaces. This means that it can receive a connection from the network card, from the loopback interface or any other interface... anyone can connect to it
* local address 127.0.0.1 means that the service is only listening for connection from that PC. not from the internet or anywhere else... this is interesting to us
* local address 192.168.1.9 means that the service is only listening for connections from the local network, So someone in the local network can connect to it, but not someone from the internet... this is also interesting to us

## Port Forward using Plink

```bash
plink.exe -l root -pw mysecretpassword 192.168.0.101 -R 8080:127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Port Forward using Meterpreter

```bash
portfwd add -l <attacker port> -p <victim port> -r <victim ip>
portfwd add -l 3306 -p 3306 -r 192.168.1.101
```
